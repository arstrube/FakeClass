RUNTIME-SELECTABLE CPPUTEST FAKE CLASS EXAMPLE

Sometimes it is desirable to test a module itself, then fake it
out for something else to be tested, all in the same test executable.
This cannot be done via linker substitution.

The following is a very basic example of how to set up fake classes
that can be swapped at run-time.

The assumption is that the code to be tested is written in pure C. 
Our fake classess, on the other hand, work by harnessing the full 
power of object-oriented design and the C++ language. I have tried
to keep everything as simple as possible.

Used.c          - A C Module that other code depends on
User.c          - A C Module that uses the above
UsedFake.cpp    - Classes that allow swapping at run-time between
                  the real implementation, mocks, stubs, or dummies
                  for the Used module.
RunAllTests.cpp - Unit tests that test-drive all of the above and
                  demonstrate how to use it.

This is just a very basic example; no guarantees for usefulness
or anything! Use as a template for building your own fake classes.
